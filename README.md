## Creation of a website describing my professional experiences

The goal was to create a fully fonctional website, with connected web pages to apply coding technics (from HTML and CSS langages) I recently dicovered. As I am seeking new challenges for my next professional experience, I created it as a resume format, to be able to send it to forms applications.
<br> It is suitable to all screen sizes, as I also worked on the reactive part of this website. There are some hovers to make it more interesting to navigate on, and some links to discover!

### A preview of the website :
